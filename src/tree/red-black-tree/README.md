- Red-black tree is a binary search tree in which each node is colored red or black.
- Root node is colored black
- A red node can only have black children
- If a node of BST does not have left or right child then we add an external node.

- the black depth of an external node is defined as the number of black ancestor it has.
- In the red-black tree every node has the same black depth.
